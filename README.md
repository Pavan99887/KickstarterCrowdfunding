# Kickstarter Crowdfunding Analysis 

Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that allows individuals and entrepreneurs to raise funds for various projects and ideas.

The concept behind Kickstarter is creators propose a project and set a funding goal they need to reach within a specified timeframe. Supporters, or "backers," can pledge money to support the project. If the funding goal is met by the end of the campaign, the project is considered successful, and the backers' credit cards are charged. If the funding goal is not met, no money is collected from the backers.

## **Overview of the project:** ##

**Data Collection**: I gathered data from Kickstarte website and this data was organized into four separate datasets.

**Data Cleaning**: To ensure the data was accurate and usable, I cleaned it by removing all the inconsistencies.

**Data Enhancement**: I added necessary columns to the datasets to make them suitable for analysis. This may have included adding information that was missing.

**Time Conversion**: The data included epoch time, which is not very human-friendly. So, I converted these epoch times into a format that is easily understandable for people.

**Data Modeling**: To draw meaningful insights, I merged the different datasets and structured them for analysis.

**Dashboard Creation**: I designed dashboards to visualize the data. These dashboards make it easier to see and understand key trends and statistics. For example, I have created visuals showing the most successful projects, total number of backers,total amount raised for projects, and the KPI's related to achieving project goals.

**Tools Used:** MS Excel, Power BI, MySQL, Tableau

## Here's what the analysis uncovers: ##
